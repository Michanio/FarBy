Inspired by Achtung die kurve game.
Written in Python (3.4) with use of the Pygame.

Right now it allows two or three players mode. In the free time I'm planning to write a class for some sliding menu, increasing max number of players to 5 and working on the color sets.

Have fun playing the game and feel free to play with the code ;)
