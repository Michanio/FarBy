Inspired by Achtung die kurve game.
Written in Python (3.4) with use of the Pygame.

Right now it allows two or three players mode. In the free time I'm planning to write a class for some sliding menu, increase max number of players to 5, work on the color sets and make some other improvements.

Have fun playing the game and feel free to change and submit the code ;)

**Rules**
You handle yor line and you must sidetrack the lines of other players and walls. For each death of the opponent you get one point. When only one player has left, the round is finished. For the 2 players mode max score is set to 5, for 3 players mode - to 10.

**Controls**

Player1 (RED): Left, Right (keys)

Player2 (GREEN): a, s

Player3 (BLUE): k, l
