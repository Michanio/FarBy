Inspired by Achtung die kurve game.
Written in Python (3.4) with use of the Pygame library.

Right now it allows two or three players mode. In the free time I'm planning to improve a class responsible for game menu (include writing the HELP section), increase max number of players to 5, work on the color sets and make some other changes (rewrite some parts of the code to achieve simpler and clearer code + comments describing how consecutive methods works).

Have fun playing the game and feel free to change and submit the code ;)

**Rules**

You handle yor line and you must sidetrack the lines of other players and walls. For each death of the opponent you get one point. When only one player has left, the round is finished. For the 2 players mode max score is set to 5, for 3 players mode - to 10.

**Controls**

Player1 (RED): Left, Right (keys)

Player2 (GREEN): a, s

Player3 (BLUE): k, l
